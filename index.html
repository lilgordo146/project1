            <h2>About Garrett Comer</h2>
            <p>Garrett is a junior on the Skyline XC team. After a mediocre freshman year and a devastating season-ending injury his sophomore year, 
            Garrett was more determined than ever to run well. He was one of the most consistent runners on the team, getting that top-7 spot on 
            the team every single race. He excelled in not just running but also motivating by always leading cheers and getting everyone hyped 
            up while still staying positive. His favorite memories of the team were being at camp with everyone and playing games all day while 
            still being full of energy. His favorite race was at Holly when their team placed first and went up on stage together with a big 
            trophy.</p>
